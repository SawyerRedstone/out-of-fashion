# Out of Fashion

The goal of this project is to generate images of shirts. 

Well, in theory, anyway.

What this model produces will probably not look like a shirt. If I'm lucky, it *may* look like an image. Fingers crossed.

I have never learned how to generate images and am going entirely off of the silly ideas floating around in my brain that I've been eager to explore. Will this succeed? Almost certainly not, but we can't find out if we don't try!

Eventually, I may branch out beyond shirts to other fashionable silhouettes, such as pants. (I know, I can be a bit of a daredevil sometimes.)

## What to Expect
- Attempts to turn 784 pixels into "clothing".
- Probably a lot of broken code and strange blobs.
- Perhaps, one day, a shirt-like shape.

## Tools
- Python
- PyTorch
- Matplotlib (for viewing the damage)
- Fashion MNIST (so the data at least starts fashionable)

## License
MIT, because everyone deserves to suffer fashion failure equally.
